# **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)**

## **Project Overview**

The Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) is a hackathon project designed to build a data-driven solution for urban traffic management. By leveraging real-time data and AI-powered logic, the system simulates intelligent traffic control to reduce congestion, optimize signal timing, and provide city authorities with actionable insights using a modern web technology stack.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Many urban centers still rely on fixed-time traffic signals that fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions, leading to:

- Extended waiting times at intersections
- Inefficient handling of peak traffic and rush hours
- Lack of real-time monitoring and predictive analytics
- Underutilization of existing road infrastructure

This project demonstrates how dynamic, data-driven traffic light optimization can address these challenges through AI-powered decision-making.

## **System Capabilities**

STMS provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring, simulating, and optimizing intersection traffic.

### **Core Features**

- **Live Traffic Status**: Real-time congestion levels per intersection (Low/Medium/High)
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded traffic status (Green/Yellow/Red)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive charts and traffic flow analytics
- **AI Optimization**: Adaptive signal timing using predictive traffic models
- **Traffic Load Prediction**: Machine learning model to forecast traffic volume and optimize signal timing
- **Congestion Forecasting**: AI-powered algorithm to predict congestion levels using historical data
- **Scenario Simulation**: Configurable simulations for rush hours, incidents, and delays
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Intersection and city-level map-based views *(planned)*
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for congestion zones
- **Data Export**: CSV and report generation for analysis
- **Chat Interface**: User-friendly chatbot with message history and customizable responses
